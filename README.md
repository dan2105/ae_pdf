# Proton-p.d.f-with-lepton-emission

In this analysis we aim to study the proton structure with parton density function by considering
the lepton emission.

In this repository you will find:

* A macro to convert .hepmc files to .root
* Analysis macro to produce the final plots.
* Macro to do cosmetics with the final histograms done by root.
